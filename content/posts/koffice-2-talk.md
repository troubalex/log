I made my debut as a speaker on wednesday. I think I mentioned that before... once or twice... maybe... Just let me put it like that: it was exciting and I liked it. And I'm so happy how my slides turned out that I will put them up again here. Call me vain. **\[UPDATE\]** I heard your complaints. Let me know if this slideshare widget doesn't work either.
