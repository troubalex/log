After trying to visit [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/2008/) already last year (and failing unfortunately) I made it to Berlin this time. In beforehand some organizing was still needed as [Franz Keferb√∂ck](http://franz.keferboeck.info/blog/) who initially planned to take care of this couldn't handle it because he temporarily had no internet access. So I jumped in and together with Claudia Rauch - the smart and lovely KDE office girl - we got it going for the booth. I spent most of my time at the booth giving information, answering questions and showing some KDE magic - even on my mac. I met a bunch of new people and matched some names and faces. It even seems I get a program written I have been nagging people for quite a while now. If I manage to compile it that is... There were some really awesome and reliable guys who gave a lot of time and energy to the booth. Most of them dressed in blue KDE t-shirts. Unfortunately I only had my camera phone to take pics which are incredibly blurry. Anyone who wants to send me some? Thomas? Alex? Sebastian? Aaron??? Oh... as I mention Aaron Seigo... I had quite some fun with my geeky company. LinuxTag chose a pretty cool location at Kreuzberg for the social event and although it was freakingly hot and humid inside and the music wasn't quite my cup of tea I enjoyed the party. I only could have slept a bit more... And now you probably think we mostly had fun and that was all. Oh no. How. Could. You. Ever. ? KDE is worth talking about and all those I listened to did a really good job on it. Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to attend the talks on Friday - KDE had its own track - as I was leaving in the afternoon. And because I am dumb I missed my train and had to take the one that left an hour later. I just couldn't take my eyes off [Roland Wolters](http://liquidat.wordpress.com/) simply planned my leaving bad enough to arrive at the station in Spandau when the ICE left on the other platform. Note to myself: learn how to read a watch and understand it correctly!
