We had some busy days over here at [Qt Software](http://www.qtsoftware.com). I spent most of yesterday digging through comments on blogs and forums, monitoring twitter and other social services and generally having eyes and ears on the discussions going on. Multitasking at its finest for the whole team. It was great to read through all the feedback and it was just amazing how much help we got from you fellow KDE friends on various places on the web. I saw many of you answering questions or moving the discussion into the right direction. **A big, big thank you to everybody for this!** And to make it complete: we switched domains over the weekend. trolltech.com has retired and is now replaced by [qtsoftware.com](http://www.qtsoftware.com)
