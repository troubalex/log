## Chapter 3: Concept stories

- Conceptual story model of the product illustrating big picture overview
- Outlines how customers think about the product
- Used to communicate core concept and value proposition
- Foundation to everything that gets built
- Help to answer those questions:
    - Who is this product for?
        - What is their problem?
        - What is their big goal? Secondary goals?
    - What *is* this product?
    - What is the competition?
    - Why might someone not want to use this product?
    - How is this product better than the competition?
    - What does this product need to do?
        - What is the straightforward solution to the problem?
        - What is the awesome solution to the problem?
- Use concept stories to communicate a shared vision and build alignment, and to innovate and prioritise against the vision
### How Concept Stories Work
- Concept stories are illustrations of customers’ mental calculations when encountering a product; they can be aspirational if there is no data
- **Exposition:** current state of things for the target user (character and their needs)
- **Inciting Incident/Problem**: why can’t the customer meet their goal? What problem do they have? How do they solve it today?
- **Rising Action:** the product comes to a rescue (should have a name and a brief description or market category); keep it short and straight to the point\
“Think of a concept story as a way to visualize and bolster a short, impactful, bulletproof elevator pitch.”
- **Crisis:** the competition – other products or services, resistance to change, etc.
- **Climax/Resolution:** the customer overcomes the difficulties described as the problem; they way the product solves the problem is its value proposition (why is a better solution than the current one?)
- **Falling Action:** imaginary, _plausible_ takeaway of the story’s hero; an envisioned path forward (stay in the realm of thought and emotions)
- **End:** the hero can see herself meet her goal

### Avoiding the Anticlimactic 
- Flat stories are anticlimactic; crisis and climax add structure and excitement to the story
### Supporting the story
- Features, functionality and packaging of the product need to deliver on the story that you promise
### Mapping a Concept Story
- Answer questions about the target customer, what works today, their big goal, their problem, the product, the competition, hurdles or barriers, the solution, value proposition and differentiator, the ideal take-away, the ideal end state, the business goal; then map them on a narrative arc
