I'll lose my virginity over this weekend. I have arrived in Berlin this afternoon to attend the KOffice sprint. It's kind of surprising, I never expected to do things like going to a developer meeting... We have plans - and we have a schedule! - for what has to be done in respect of promotion and marketing for the upcomingÂ  release and I am really curious about the results. So stay tuned for updates.
