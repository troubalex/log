After a flood of emails - with increasing frequency - to various people, a completely useless document, and some tearing at hair on my side, I managed to organize a booth and gather staff for [Systems in Munich](http://systems.de) again. So if you plan to visit the exhibition don't forget to drop by and say hello to Dominik, Eckhart, Frederik and Holger who devote quite some time to presenting KDE to business people wearing suits. Many thanks to them!
