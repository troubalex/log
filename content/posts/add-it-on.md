I spent a rather large part of my working hours on the internet: reading feeds, monitoring microblogging sites or sharing blogs and articles via bookmarking services. To keep it short: I live in my web browser.

### Extensions to my rescue

The smartest thing about Firefox is its extendability. There is a ton of more or less useful add-ons available on Mozilla's Add-on site that solve even those issues you have hardly thought about before finding the extension. I collected a list of extensions I use more or less every day for my colleagues who will jump to my side on the internet and I thought it might be of interest to more people. It's a huge list that covers a lot areas from the usual Google enhancements to more juicy things like Geasemonkey scripts and I will split it up into several blog postings over the next weeks.
