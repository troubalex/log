Hum... I guess it's been a while since I last blogged. This time however I have something to show off: [Till's](http://hubbahubba.de) and my presentation at [CampKDE](http://camp.kde.org) is on YouTube. And without further ado -- enjoy the show.  The slides are quite visible in the video but I thought embedding them here wouldn't hurt.

View more [presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/) from [Alexandra Leisse](http://www.slideshare.net/troubalex).

If you are interested in the rest of the talks, head over to the [KDE Promo channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/kdepromo) on YouTube and take a look. Slides are available from [here](http://www.kde.org/kdeslides).
