## Introduction
Start with three simple questions:

- What’s the story?
- Who is the hero?
- What’s the hero’s goal?

## Chapter 1: Mapping the Story
- People experience products
- If you want to engage your customers, your product must have a story at its foundation
- “Storymapping is just what it sounds like: mapping out an intended experience of use for a product, plot point by plot point.”
- Make things go BOOM!
- When experiences are based on a story, people are more likely to
    - Remember the experience.
    - See value in what was experienced.
    - See utility in what they did during that experience.
    - Have an easier time doing whatever they were trying to accomplish.
    - Want to repeat that experience.
- Stories drive engagement

## Chapter 2: How Story Works

- Every story needs three things: characters, goals, and conflict
- Elements of a story
    - Exposition
        - Introduces characters and their world
    - Inciting incident or problem
        - Something changes or goes dramatically wrong
        - A call to action for the hero
        - First hook or trigger point
    - Rising action
        - Story escalates and creates new tensions and conflicts
        - Anticipation and excitement builds
        - Conflict keeps engagement up and makes endings feel well earned
    - Crisis
        - Culmination point of maximum crisis
        - The hero has to succeed or be defeated trying
    - Climax or resolution
        - Most important part of the story!
        - All tension built up earlier cumulates
    - Falling action or denouement
        - Conflict is resolved and the story wraps up
        - Falling action provides closure
        - Should happen as quickly as possible because humans are impatient
    - End
        - Character should meet their goal and be changed
        - The end can lead to a new story/sequel
- Stories can be used to prototype and test hypotheses
- “Your brain seeks out a story in the data it consumes. And that story has a structure to it, whether you realize it or not. This behavior is so natural that you probably don’t even notice that you do it.”
- Products need to make the customer the hero to be loved
