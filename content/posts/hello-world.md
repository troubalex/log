_Inspired by (okay, stolen from) [Elisabeth Irgens](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2017/06/hello-world/)_

Let's try something different. I need to get my perfectionism under control when it comes to writing, so I decided to follow Elisabeth's example, and try a low-key way of writing down things I learn or stumble upon. Kind of like a log.

I constantly learn new things about building product, growing a team, and creating a company from nothing at [VIBBIO](https://vibbio.com), I might as well jot it down.
