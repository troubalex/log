Today, we added a new member to the family of Qt websites. Some weeks ago, we had a creative coffee break in the Oslo office with rather bad coffee but nice cookies (did you know that Norwegians make really good cookies?). Sitting on the comfy couches, someone raised the issue (or should I say: challenge?) that we don't have a place where we can show all the creative and uncommon projects that pop up on blogs and land in our inboxes from time to time. Enter [QtOverload](http://www.qtoverload.com)! On this new blog, we want to collect cute little applications, code snippets or screenshots (or whatever else fits) and give credit to the enormous creative potential that our toolkit sets free in cute Qt programmers. We bet that you have something extra cute sitting on your hard drive or living somewhere in the back of your head. Don't let it gather dust any longer and send your ideas over to submissions \[at\] qtoverload \[dot\] com. We'll finally give them the attention they deserve! We're very excited about this new project and looking forward to your submissions.
