There is a lot of thinking going on it seems. Please, head over to Socceroos and read this [blog](http://socceroosd.blogspot.com/2008/10/future-of-kdes-online-presence.html). I first learnt about this concept during Akademy and I think it's pretty exciting. If you're interested (and have the time) join the meeting on #kde-www which is announced [here](http://socceroosd.blogspot.com/2008/10/its-on-meeting-this-friday.html). The details can be found on [techbase](http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/kde.org/Meetings/September08).
