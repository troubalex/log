We are approaching the release of Qt 4.6. To make it rock as much as we can we have just started a beta program where we collect feedback. If you're interested in joining, please read the [details on Volker's blog](http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/09/30/join-the-qt-46-beta-program/). The program is open to everybody and and joining is not needed to test the beta.
