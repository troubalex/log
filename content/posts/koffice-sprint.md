This sprint turns out to have been pretty productive. The marketing team (Inge, Jos, Sebas and me) has managed to get all topics covered and now has a finished marketing strategy. I even introduced everybody to the idea of a social stream of all developers involved and people started playing with our demo (thanks to [Dirk Olbertz](http://noserub.com/blog/) for setting that up!).

Those developers who have already left apparently did so with a good mood. They worked hard during this two days at the [KDAB](http://kdab.com/) office (thanks to them for hosting us again!). It didn't even distract them that the office is right in the middle of a **huge** variety of restaurants, pubs and cocktail bars. There was a lot of more or less quiet hacking going on and I observed some vivid discussions about _not so common_ topics. And of course I learnt some new things like doing a SWOT analysis, that it makes sense to arrive well rested and that wikis can look surprisingly pretty.
