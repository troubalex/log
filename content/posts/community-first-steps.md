Time flies. 15 years ago I published my first community fuelled website. It's long gone of course but I can still tell the story.

### It all started with an anniversary

One of my all-time favourite children's TV show went into it's 25th year at the time. I still watched it on a regular basis and so I had an idea. Why not send a special greeting card? One that would be fun to make and a bit different?

### There was the plan

I had been playing with HTML and spent a decent amount of time on mailing-lists and in usenet groups. So I sent out a call to action to some German groups and asked for small text contributions to the greeting card . And I asked people to spread the idea. I don't remember how many people replied but in the end I had a nice collection. I charmed a friend to upload my orange page to the tiny webspace he had available at university.

### Lesson learned

Looking back it appears to be a small thing but it taught me something important: if you have an idea, run with it. If others like it, run the whole way. The tools have changed and [my approach to community has matured](http://developer.qt.nokia.com) but at the heart of it, this lesson still stands. (Thank you, [Birte](http://www.facebook.com/birte.lilienthal), for reminding me today!)
