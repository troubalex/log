The talks were quite technical, but still interesting to me. At least the part that I actually understood. Nevertheless I learnt something: I knew about cultural differences between Asia and Europe before but it was new to me that those between Europe and (South- and Middle-) America were nearly as big. For today I plan a BoF on collaboration between the KDE community in North America and Qt Software to plan how to leverage KDE along with Qt and hopefully another one on the needs of the communities on Middle and Southern America, now that I actually have members of our community from there at hand. So to speak.
