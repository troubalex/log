It's this time again. Technically, we started last night already with _team building_ (aka socializing aka dinner) but today is the first day of real work. We were kindly invited into the [KDAB](http://kdab.net) office in Berlin-Kreuzberg again and I have the strong feeling that Inge is seriously aiming for killing the coffee reserve. We went through various presentations already ([see Hanna's blog](http://hannascott.blogspot.com/) for details) which lead to very interesting discussions. I don't even get a third of the content but I am tweaking the new website in the meantime. Or maybe I should just sleep another hour. Breakfast at 8 is so not my time...
