      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting on this mind map for quite some time now but never got around to properly documenting my thoughts. Chances are that it will never happen so I&amp;rsquo;ll put it up for grabs. The mind map is huge. In an ideal world, a new release would be supported by a whole team pushing buttons on all sorts of social networks. The world is unfortunately rarely ideal, so the team will have to prioritize depending on its size, audience and preference.</description>

      <description>I attended the 4.2 release event in Zurich on Wednesday and I must say: it was pretty crowded. Pascal and Luca and whoelse helped them did a good job on organizing the whole event, including Ap√©ro with FreeBeer and snacks. I listened to the keynote by Georg Greve, President of the FSFE, and to Aaron who impressed with his live presentation. I found a first set of photos on flickr. It gives a nice idea of the event.</description>

      <description>I did some boring cut&amp;amp;paste work today to make up a page of press reviews after the last release. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d like to read some of the reviews or send the URL to your friends or digg any article you like. Anyway&amp;hellip; a lot to read out there! If we missed anything, please let me know! Note to the German readers: I like the review at golem.de (scroll down to find the exact URL!</description>
