      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting on this mind map for quite some time now but never got around to properly documenting my thoughts. Chances are that it will never happen so I&amp;rsquo;ll put it up for grabs. The mind map is huge. In an ideal world, a new release would be supported by a whole team pushing buttons on all sorts of social networks. The world is unfortunately rarely ideal, so the team will have to prioritize depending on its size, audience and preference.</description>

      <description>Ariya complained about me being too theoretical again and wanted examples for my last blog. So here we go. One of my alltime favourite online companies is moo.com.

They make those lovely mini cards, post cards, shiny little stickers, and cleverly use a lot of 3rd party services on the web both for their products and their marketing. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;240&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;quot;Social Network by Luc Legay&amp;rdquo;][/caption] I have been thinking. This is not quite unusual but this time it had a reason: August√≠n&amp;rsquo;s blog about Social Networks and Lydia&amp;rsquo;s identi.ca review. With the introduction of so called Social Networks and Social Features on a lot of websites, the way we see and use the internet has changed from broadcasting to joining conversations. The good news is that KDE - like most FLOSS communities - is very well set.</description>
