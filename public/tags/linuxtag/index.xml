      <description>Three weeks of travel are finally over. I enjoyed most of it but it took it&amp;rsquo;s toll. One of the reasons I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the summit was as successful for me personally than it could have been. During the four days in Berlin I spent mostly in the halls of LinuxTag, I had the energy and ease to walk around and talk to people although the preparation of the whole event had taken quite some effort from my side.</description>
