      <description>I get asked on a regular basis if it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to apply for a job at an early stage startup. As usual, the answer is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;. There are clear pros and cons, in my opinion.
Pros  You learn incredibly fast You have a lot of influence on what your job looks like You are part of an extremely tight-knit team of people You get a lot more responsibility than in established companies  Cons  You usually need to figure out a lot of things on your own Priorities shift often and quickly Those shifts can feel random and uninvited Usually, nobody has time to mentor you You get a lot more responsibility than in established companies You might feel very lonely  I usually tell folks that it really depends on how secure they feel with what they know and what they don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>
