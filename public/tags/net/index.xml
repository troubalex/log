      <title>What is it that we learn?</title>

      <description>If you don’t read this entire post, or if you take nothing else away from it, then just remember these points:
 When you learn something, write about it, and don’t do it just to make money off it. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes. Teaching others will help you learn. Encourage collaboration by allowing a free flow of constructive comments. If you make a mistake, fix it.  I think this is a winning strategy for all those who are involved in design or development blogging, as well as tutorial writing.</description>

      <title>Supporting Software Product Releases with Social Media Tools</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting on this mind map for quite some time now but never got around to properly documenting my thoughts. Chances are that it will never happen so I&amp;rsquo;ll put it up for grabs. The mind map is huge. In an ideal world, a new release would be supported by a whole team pushing buttons on all sorts of social networks. The world is unfortunately rarely ideal, so the team will have to prioritize depending on its size, audience and preference.</description>

      <title>Community: my first steps</title>

      <description>Time flies. 15 years ago I published my first community fuelled website. It&amp;rsquo;s long gone of course but I can still tell the story. It all started with an anniversary One of my all-time favourite children&amp;rsquo;s TV show went into it&amp;rsquo;s 25th year at the time. I still watched it on a regular basis and so I had an idea. Why not send a special greeting card? One that would be fun to make and a bit different?</description>

      <description>Ariya complained about me being too theoretical again and wanted examples for my last blog. So here we go. One of my alltime favourite online companies is moo.com. I bet you heard me talking about it already. They make those lovely mini cards, post cards, shiny little stickers, and cleverly use a lot of 3rd party services on the web both for their products and their marketing. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;quot;240&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;quot;Social Network by Luc Legay&amp;rdquo;][/caption] I have been thinking. This is not quite unusual but this time it had a reason: Augustín&amp;rsquo;s blog about Social Networks and Lydia&amp;rsquo;s identi.ca review. With the introduction of so called Social Networks and Social Features on a lot of websites, the way we see and use the internet has changed from broadcasting to joining conversations. The good news is that KDE - like most FLOSS communities - is very well set.</description>

      <title>Firefox extensions for Google Apps</title>

      <description>Google Apps like Mail, Reader, Calendar and Docs make cover a big part of my daily work flow. This is mostly because I switch between various machines and operating systems on a regular basis and not so much because I think they are better or whatever than the usual suspects on the desktops. These are the add-ons I still use after an extensive time of testing. Better GMail 2 This one compiles several user generated Greasemonkey scripts into a single add-on: it adds little icons to emails with attachements, shows the amount of unread messages in the tab header, hides unnecessary clutter in the sidebar, adds folders and much more.</description>

      <description>I spent a rather large part of my working hours on the internet: reading feeds, monitoring microblogging sites or sharing blogs and articles via bookmarking services. To keep it short: I live in my web browser.
Extensions to my rescue The smartest thing about Firefox is its extendability. There is a ton of more or less useful add-ons available on Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Add-on site that solve even those issues you have hardly thought about before finding the extension.</description>

      <title>KOffice Web Concept</title>

      <description>Things are in the move it seems and I am still all about drafting concepts for a renewal of the KOffice web presence. We have been discussing this on IRC a bit and it seems that quite some people liked the ideas, so I chose to present them here to give others the opportunity to think about it and maybe reuse it or make smart™ suggestions. ;) From simple to complex My starting point was to find a solution to present KOffice independently without doubling maintenance work and spreading ressources even further on the net.</description>

      <title>FlickrRSS workaround</title>

      <description>Since I upgraded my wordpress install, the FlickrRSS plugin I used to show thumbnails of my photos at the top of my blog has stopped working. Nothing serious, just a bit annoying. Over the weekend I took the time to finally get the pics back. The Plugin still didn&amp;rsquo;t work, so I decided to throw out both the plugin and the associated PHP code in the main template. Instead I took the one flickr provides for badges, removed all the CSS that comes with it and kept only the single line of JavaScript, within which I changed the amount of shown thumbnails from 10 to 9.</description>

      <title>Going Web2.0?</title>

      <description>There has been some reflections going on about the use of the so called social web after our BoFs at Akademy this summer. I came across some difficulties during the last days though.
Hasn&amp;rsquo;t the web been social all the time? In the early days, when I first came across the concept of the internet, usegroups and mailing-lists were entirely social. With broader acceptance of the internet itself, things changed to a more presenting approach.</description>
