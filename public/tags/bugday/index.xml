      <description>As you may have noticed, KOffice is approching a 2.0 release. There is still some work to do and here&amp;rsquo;s where you come in. It was already announced on the dot: Sunday (which is tomorrow) will be the first official KOffice Bug Day. Or Krush Mastery as Lemma called it. We&amp;rsquo;ll start at 7:00 UTC and gather on #kde-bugs to hunt down known bugs and find some new in the latest release.</description>
