      <description>Today, we added a new member to the family of Qt websites. Some weeks ago, we had a creative coffee break in the Oslo office with rather bad coffee but nice cookies (did you know that Norwegians make really good cookies?). Sitting on the comfy couches, someone raised the issue (or should I say: challenge?) that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a place where we can show all the creative and uncommon projects that pop up on blogs and land in our inboxes from time to time.</description>
