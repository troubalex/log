      <description>After having a quick chat with Kévin Ottens on IRC we agreed that it would be useful to write up a small how-to explaining the Art of Booth Organization™ as a follow up on the how-to for sprints I posted earlier. He has been poking me about it repeatedly, so voilà, Monsieur, finalement, c&amp;rsquo;est fait. While writing down all those steps I realized that organizing a booth is more complex than I thought.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the German Bahn, I gained an hour offline in a train. All my tasks I could finish without the internet are done now, so I thought to myself I could as well blog something. I squeezed myself into the ICE to Basel SBB with a incredibly heavy suitcase, a backpack, a cardboard roll holding posters and my handbag. A whole hour later than planned because of severe stupidness on my side.</description>
