      <description>If you don’t read this entire post, or if you take nothing else away from it, then just remember these points:
 When you learn something, write about it, and don’t do it just to make money off it. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes. Teaching others will help you learn. Encourage collaboration by allowing a free flow of constructive comments. If you make a mistake, fix it.  I think this is a winning strategy for all those who are involved in design or development blogging, as well as tutorial writing.</description>
