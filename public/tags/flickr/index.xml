      <description>Since I upgraded my wordpress install, the FlickrRSS plugin I used to show thumbnails of my photos at the top of my blog has stopped working. Nothing serious, just a bit annoying. Over the weekend I took the time to finally get the pics back. The Plugin still didn&amp;rsquo;t work, so I decided to throw out both the plugin and the associated PHP code in the main template. Instead I took the one flickr provides for badges, removed all the CSS that comes with it and kept only the single line of JavaScript, within which I changed the amount of shown thumbnails from 10 to 9.</description>
