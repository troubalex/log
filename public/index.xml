      <description>I gave a presentation last night at a meetup in Bergen which was essentially about people management. I was invited to share my experience from building a remote team at VIBBIO but a lot of the points I covered apply to pretty much all kinds of teams in some form.
One of the points I covered was basically how I adopted techniques I learned during my time at KDE. Later, that got me thinking about how those experiences prepared me for the work I am doing now, more than 10 years later.</description>

      <title>Working at an Early-Stage Startup</title>

      <description>I get asked on a regular basis if it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to apply for a job at an early stage startup. As usual, the answer is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;. There are clear pros and cons, in my opinion.
Pros  You learn incredibly fast You have a lot of influence on what your job looks like You are part of an extremely tight-knit team of people You get a lot more responsibility than in established companies  Cons  You usually need to figure out a lot of things on your own Priorities shift often and quickly Those shifts can feel random and uninvited Usually, nobody has time to mentor you You get a lot more responsibility than in established companies You might feel very lonely  I usually tell folks that it really depends on how secure they feel with what they know and what they don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>

      <description>Inspired by (okay, stolen from) Elisabeth Irgens
Let&amp;rsquo;s try something different. I need to get my perfectionism under control when it comes to writing, so I decided to follow Elisabeth&amp;rsquo;s example, and try a low-key way of writing down things I learn or stumble upon. Kind of like a log.
I constantly learn new things about building product, growing a team, and creating a company from nothing at VIBBIO, I might as well jot it down.</description>

      <title>What is it that we learn?</title>

      <description>If you donâ€™t read this entire post, or if you take nothing else away from it, then just remember these points:
 When you learn something, write about it, and donâ€™t do it just to make money off it. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes. Teaching others will help you learn. Encourage collaboration by allowing a free flow of constructive comments. If you make a mistake, fix it.  I think this is a winning strategy for all those who are involved in design or development blogging, as well as tutorial writing.</description>

      <title>Supporting Software Product Releases with Social Media Tools</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting on this mind map for quite some time now but never got around to properly documenting my thoughts. Chances are that it will never happen so I&amp;rsquo;ll put it up for grabs. The mind map is huge. In an ideal world, a new release would be supported by a whole team pushing buttons on all sorts of social networks. The world is unfortunately rarely ideal, so the team will have to prioritize depending on its size, audience and preference.</description>

      <title>Community: my first steps</title>

      <description>Time flies. 15 years ago I published my first community fuelled website. It&amp;rsquo;s long gone of course but I can still tell the story. It all started with an anniversary One of my all-time favourite children&amp;rsquo;s TV show went into it&amp;rsquo;s 25th year at the time. I still watched it on a regular basis and so I had an idea. Why not send a special greeting card? One that would be fun to make and a bit different?</description>

      <description>Hum&amp;hellip; I guess it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last blogged. This time however I have something to show off: Till&amp;rsquo;s and my presentation at CampKDE is on YouTube. And without further ado &amp;ndash; enjoy the show. The slides are quite visible in the video but I thought embedding them here wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt.

If you are interested in the rest of the talks, head over to the KDE Promo channel on YouTube and take a look.</description>

      <description>After having a quick chat with KÃ©vin Ottens on IRC we agreed that it would be useful to write up a small how-to explaining the Art of Booth Organizationâ„¢Â as a follow up on the how-to for sprints I posted earlier. He has been poking me about it repeatedly, so voilÃ , Monsieur, finalement, c&amp;rsquo;est fait. While writing down all those steps I realized that organizing a booth is more complex than I thought.</description>

      <description>We are approaching the release of Qt 4.6. To make it rock as much as we can we have just started a beta program where we collect feedback. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in joining, please read the details on Volker&amp;rsquo;s blog. The program is open to everybody and and joining is not needed to test the beta.</description>
