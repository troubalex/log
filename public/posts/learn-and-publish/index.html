<p>My first reaction was &ldquo;duh!&quot;. But then I thought again and asked myself if I really do write about the things I learn. Obviously, I dont. Since it&rsquo;s so obvious to me, the question is &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; It seems to boil down to a couple of reasons: First, I&rsquo;m lazy. Blogging is a lot of work and I don&rsquo;t always have the energy, or patience, to sit down after work and write. I also have other interests, so the lack of time doesn&rsquo;t really help either. Then, I tend to over-think it. Writing a blog appears to be a major undertaking: I hardly ever manage to think of a blog as a relatively limited task, even if I don&rsquo;t plan to write a comprehensive project report. Which is a bit silly because I am happily using <a href="http://twitter.com/troubalex">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://troubalex.de">Posterous</a> to capture all my not so very brilliant thoughts and comments. I could as well use it for other things. I also constantly battle my inner critic* that keeps telling me that everything has been said about a topic already, and most likely by more qualified or experienced people than me. Chances are, they are better writers, too. Of course, I <strong>know</strong> it&rsquo;s stupid, it still sets the bar for myself too high to even get started. Finally, and that is the most interesting part, I don&rsquo;t necessarily see the things I have learned. How could I publish them? I am constantly learning. If I should make a list of the top 5 things I have learnt during the last week, for example, I would be at a loss. Fine, I learnt some useful tricks in spreadsheets but that is probably not very exciting. Speaking of it, the actual insight I took away from this week was probably that they cannot be avoided for certain tasks, no matter how hard you try. In this particular case, I was &ndash; and still am &ndash; working on a content inventory of qt.nokia.com, and after trying to squeeze it all into a mind map I carved in, and put all the pages into a spreadsheet. The bigger thing I learnt however, was how to compile a content inventory that actually makes sense. To blog about this would surely be a major undertaking, and I am certain someone has written extensively about it already&hellip; *) Wonderful article by <a href="http://denisejacobs.com/" title="Denise Jacobs">Denise Jacobs</a> on the topic: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/banishing-your-inner-critic/">Banishing Your Inner Critic</a> on A List Apart.</p>
